Normally, when monetary policy has room for manoeuvre and the private sector's borrowing is unconstrained,that is right.
通常情况下,如果货币政策有回旋余地,私人部门借贷也不受约束,这种想法并没有错.
In particular,with the real interest rate well below the rate of growth of economies,the expansion of credit was effectively unconstrained.
特别是,由于实际利率远低于经济增长率,信贷扩张实际上不受限制.
